IconWizard makes folder customization magical on Windows. Change folder icons via right-click, extract icons from executables, convert between image formats (PNG/JPG/ICO/WebP) and process entire folders. Smart detection finds the best icons automatically. Supports rounded corners and instant visual refresh. Portable batch script—drag, drop, done!
